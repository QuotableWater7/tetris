            <h3>Overview</h3>
            My goal coming into the hackathon was to gather some ideas for generating music automatically for internet games.  My apps use the Echo Nest "Dynamic Playlisting" API to play songs in a specific genre and tempo based on what is happening in the game.

            <h5>The Apps</h5>
            <ul>
              <li><a href="tetris_v1">Tetris v1</a> - increases the tempo of the played song each time the user clears a row.  In reality, I would have the tempo increase with levels...  but I used line clearing so I could see the effect much quicker.</li>
              <li><a href="tetris_v2">Tetris v2</a> - in this version, music is selected based on how close the user is to losing.  When blocks are near the bottom, I select rock tracks with a tempo of around 90bpm.  In the middle, I select techno tracks at about 140bpm.  Near the top, I start throwing some metal tracks at you with a tempo of about 200bpm.</li>
            </ul>
